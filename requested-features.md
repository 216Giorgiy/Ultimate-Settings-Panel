#Requested Features
This is a few things that have been requested since I created Ultimate Settings Panel that I never got around to doing.

* Drag and drop tabs - the ability to be able to move the tabbed panels around to whichever order the user would like
* Hide tabs - the ability to hide tabs that are not required by the user
* New tabs - the ability to add new tabs and drag buttons from existing tabs to it - effectively creating a customised tab for the user
* Portable version of Ultimate Settings Panel
